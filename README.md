# platform
This repo will contain my personal web platform. 

This code will later be deployed to AWS and will be paired 
with the shanewade.dev domain.  This will become my personal site

This is a next.js application leveraging next's built in
typescript functionality in conjunction with some other popular 
technologies like React, Express, and Socket.IO
